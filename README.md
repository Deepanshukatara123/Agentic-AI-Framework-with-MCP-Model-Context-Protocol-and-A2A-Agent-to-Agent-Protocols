You want to automate blog content creation using AI Agents:
 Content Collection Agent: Gathers relevant info using Bing or internal sources.
 Writer Agent: Drafts content using LLMs like Llama 3 or Mistral.
 Save Agent: Saves the blog to a file system, SharePoint, or Azure Blob Storage.
These agents are orchestrated together using AutoGen or Semantic Kernel.
